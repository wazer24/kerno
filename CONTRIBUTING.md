## Development Environment Setup

### System Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Linux kernel** | 5.8 | 6.1+ | Must have `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y` |
| **Go** | 1.24 | 1.25+ | [install](https://go.dev/doc/install) |
| **clang** | 14 | 17+ | For eBPF C compilation |
| **llvm** | 14 | 17+ | `llvm-strip` used by bpf2go |
| **libbpf-dev** | 0.8 | 1.0+ | BPF CO-RE headers |
| **bpftool** | - | latest | BTF inspection and debugging |
| **make** | 4.0 | - | Build orchestration |

### Step 1 - Install System Dependencies

**Ubuntu / Debian (22.04+):**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  clang llvm llvm-dev \
  libbpf-dev \
  linux-headers-$(uname -r) \
  linux-tools-$(uname -r) linux-tools-common \
  make gcc pkg-config \
  git curl
```

**Fedora (38+):**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
  clang llvm llvm-devel \
  libbpf-devel \
  kernel-headers kernel-devel \
  bpftool \
  make gcc pkg-config \
  git curl
```

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S \
  clang llvm \
  libbpf \
  linux-headers \
  bpf \
  make gcc pkg-config \
  git curl
```

### Step 2 - Install Go

If you don't have Go 1.24+ installed:

```bash
# Download (adjust version as needed)
curl -fsSL https://go.dev/dl/go1.25.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz -o /tmp/go.tar.gz

# Install
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf /tmp/go.tar.gz

# Add to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence)
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin

# Verify
go version
```

### Step 3 - Install Go Tooling

```bash
# Install development tools used by the Makefile
make install-tools
```

This installs:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bpf2go` | Generate Go bindings from eBPF C programs |
| `golangci-lint` | Aggregated linter (80+ checks) |
| `goreleaser` | Cross-compile and release binaries |

Or install manually:

```bash
go install github.com/cilium/ebpf/cmd/bpf2go@latest
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/v2@latest
```

### Step 4 - Verify BTF Support

Kerno requires BTF (BPF Type Format) in your kernel:

```bash
# Check if BTF is available
ls /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux && echo "BTF: OK" || echo "BTF: MISSING"

# Alternative check
bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format raw | head -c 4
```

If BTF is missing, you need a kernel compiled with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`. Most modern distro kernels (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 38+, Arch) have this enabled by default.

### Step 5 - Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/optiqor/kerno.git
cd kerno

# Standard build (uses stub BPF types - no clang required)
make build

# Verify the binary works
./bin/kerno version
./bin/kerno --help
```

### Step 6 - Full Build with eBPF Compilation (Optional)

If you're working on the eBPF C programs:

```bash
# Compile eBPF programs + generate Go bindings + build binary
make build-ebpf

# Or just compile the eBPF programs
make bpf

# Or just regenerate Go bindings
make generate
```

> **Note:** The standard `make build` uses pre-generated Go stub types (`gen_stub.go`) so you can develop and test Go code without clang/libbpf installed. Only use `make build-ebpf` when modifying the eBPF C programs.

### Step 7 - Run the Doctor (requires root)

```bash
sudo ./bin/kerno doctor
sudo ./bin/kerno doctor --duration 10s
sudo ./bin/kerno doctor --output json
```

## Building from Source

### Make Targets

| Target | Description | Requires Root | Requires clang |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| `make build` | Build binary (stub BPF) | No | No |
| `make build-ebpf` | Full build with eBPF compilation | No | **Yes** |
| `make build-debug` | Build without symbol stripping | No | No |
| `make bpf` | Compile eBPF C → `.o` files | No | **Yes** |
| `make generate` | Run `bpf2go` to generate Go types | No | **Yes** |
| `make test` | Run unit tests | No | No |
| `make test-race` | Run tests with race detector | No | No |
| `make test-cover` | Generate HTML coverage report | No | No |
| `make lint` | Run golangci-lint | No | No |
| `make vet` | Run `go vet` | No | No |
| `make fmt` | Format Go source files | No | No |
| `make check` | Run lint + test + vet (CI equivalent) | No | No |
| `make docker` | Build Docker image | No | No |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts | No | No |
| `make install-tools` | Install Go dev tools | No | No |
| `make help` | Show all targets with descriptions | No | No |

### Build Flags

The Makefile injects version metadata via `-ldflags`:

```bash
# Version comes from git describe or latest tag
# Commit comes from HEAD
# Date comes from build time
./bin/kerno version
# → kerno v0.1.0 (commit: abc1234, built: 2026-03-11T12:00:00Z, go1.25.4, linux/amd64)
```

### Docker Build

```bash
# Build multi-stage image (compiles inside container)
make docker

# Run with required privileges
docker run --privileged --pid=host \
  ghcr.io/optiqor/kerno:latest doctor
```

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (no root, no eBPF)
make test

# With race detector (slower, catches data races)
make test-race

# With HTML coverage report (opens coverage.html)
make test-cover

# Run a specific package
go test ./internal/config/... -v

# Run a specific test
go test ./internal/bpf/... -run TestSyscallEventBinaryRoundTrip -v

# Full CI check (lint + vet + test)
make check
```

**Test categories:**

- `internal/version` - Build metadata resolution tests
- `internal/config` - Configuration parsing + validation (8 table-driven tests)
- `internal/bpf` - Event binary round-trip, helper methods, type consistency
- `internal/collector` - Registry lifecycle, signal aggregation

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **`internal/`** - All packages are internal; the only public API is the CLI binary.
- **Build tag strategy** - `gen_stub.go` (`//go:build !ebpf`) provides stub types so `make build` works without clang. The real BPF-generated types are only produced when running `make generate` with the `ebpf` build tag.
- **Loader interface** - Each eBPF program has a typed Go loader implementing a common `Loader` interface, enabling uniform lifecycle management via `LoaderSet`.
- **Collector interface** - Collectors consume raw events from loaders, aggregate them into typed snapshots, and expose them via a `Registry` for the doctor engine.

## Code Style

### Go

- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
- All exported types, functions, and methods **must** have doc comments.
- Use `log/slog` for structured logging - never `fmt.Println` in library code.
- Error messages are lowercase, no trailing punctuation: `return fmt.Errorf("loading BPF program: %w", err)`.
- Wrap errors with `%w` for the entire call chain.
- Use `context.Context` as the first parameter for anything cancellable.
- Table-driven tests with `t.Run` subtests.

### eBPF (C)

- Include `vmlinux.h` first, then `<bpf/bpf_helpers.h>`, then `kerno.h`.
- Use CO-RE (`BPF_CORE_READ`) for all field access.
- Prefer tracepoints over kprobes where available.
- Keep programs small - the verifier has limits.
- Comment non-obvious kernel interactions.
- All shared structs go in `internal/bpf/c/headers/kerno.h` - the Go event types in `events.go` must match exactly.

### General

- `make lint` must pass with zero warnings.
- No `TODO` comments in merged code unless tracking a filed issue (`// TODO(#123): ...`).
- All new features require tests.
- All new CLI commands require documentation.

### Reliability & Panics

Your collector should not panic, but if it does, here's what kerno will do:
- **Crash Recovery**: The goroutine will be recovered, capturing a full stack trace.
- **Forensic Logging**: A panic trace will be saved to `/var/log/kerno-panics/` for post-mortem analysis.
- **Backoff & Restart**: The collector will automatically restart using exponential backoff (up to 60s).
- **Crash-Loop Safety**: If a collector panics 5 times within 10 minutes, kerno will permanently disable it for the remainder of the daemon's lifetime and emit a `CRITICAL` alert metric to prevent flapping.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- PRs should be focused - one concern per PR.
- Include a clear description of **what** and **why**.
- Link related issues with `Fixes #123` or `Relates to #123`.
- All CI checks must pass.
- At least one maintainer approval is required.
- Squash-merge is preferred for clean history.

## Claiming an Issue

Before starting work, claim the issue so two people don't duplicate effort:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/assign` | Assigns you to the issue |
| `/take` | Same as `/assign` |
| `/unassign` | Releases the issue back to the pool |

Just leave a comment with the command — a bot will assign you within seconds.

**Stale-claim policy:** if you don't comment, push to a linked PR, or otherwise show activity for **10 days**, the bot auto-releases the issue so others can pick it up. You'll get a heads-up at day 7, and you can always `/assign` again if you come back.

Maintainers can `/assign @someone` to assign on a contributor's behalf.

## Reporting Issues

- Use the structured [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) — bug, feature, new doctor rule, or kernel support.
- Include kernel version (`uname -r`), Go version, and kerno version.
- For eBPF verifier errors, paste the full output of `sudo ./bin/bpf-verify`.

## Security Vulnerabilities

**Do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities.** See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the responsible disclosure process.
